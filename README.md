# Document Intake Web Application

## Project Overview
The Document Intake Web Application is a Node.js-based web system designed to manage the intake, tracking, and storage of business documents.

The main objective of the application is to replace informal document storage (such as shared folders) with a structured system that enforces document lifecycle rules and controlled state transitions.

The system supports:
- Document registration with metadata and content
- Controlled document updates and status transitions
- Logical rejection and restricted physical deletion
- Document filtering by multiple criteria
- Generation of daily summary reports

The application is implemented using modern JavaScript (ES Modules) and follows a layered architecture.
